{"name":"Ydeliver","tagline":"A .Net focused build and deployment framework","google":"","body":"# YDeliver\r\n\r\nYDeliver is a (opinionated) build and deployment framework aimed at .NET projects.\r\n\r\nYDeliver is based on Powershell and the amazing psake framework. It borrows the best practices ( Ydeliver strongly belived in convention over configuration) and tricks from across the industry, with the aim of quickly bootstrapping the build and release process of typical .NET projects. \r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nYou can include YDeliver as submodule within your project (recommended), or just have it as a Powershell module in your machine to invoke builds off.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module path\\to\\YDeliver\r\n```\r\n\r\n## YBuild\r\n\r\nYBuild is the build component of YDeliver. Typically, this component is for compiling, unit testing and packaging your artifacts. YBuild comes with prebuilt tasks to clean and compile your solution, run NUnit tests and package ( zip / nuget) up your artifacts.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can run the clean, compile and package tasks by doing \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-YBuild Clean,Compile,Project\r\n```\r\nTo get a list of available tasks, you can do:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-YBuild -listAvailable\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conventions\r\n\r\nYDeliver follows certain conventions, like where to pick up the solution file, how to recognize unit test dlls, etc. These conventions are specified under `Conventions\\Defaults.ps1`\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nYou can specify configurations like which folders to package into artifacts, which projects to make nuget packages out off etc.\r\n\r\n### build.yml\r\n\r\nSpecifies the configurations for YBuild\r\n\r\n`copyContents` : For specifying files and folders to be copied from one place to another\r\n`packageContents` : For specifying file and folders to be packages into zip files\r\n`nugetSpecs` : For specifying the .nuspec files to be used to build nuget packages\r\n\r\nSample build.yml:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\ncopyContents:\r\n    \"$buildPath/cmd.dll\":   \"$buildPath/Cmd\"\r\n    \"$buildPath/cmd.pdb\":   \"$buildPath/Cmd\"\r\n    \"$buildPath/test\":      \"$buildPath/Cmd\"\r\n\r\npackageContents:\r\n    \"$buildPath/Cmd\":  \"Cmd.zip\"\r\n\r\nnugetSpecs:   [cmd.nuspec]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What's ahead?\r\n\r\nLots more documentation.\r\nBringing in the deploy component.","note":"Don't delete this file!
